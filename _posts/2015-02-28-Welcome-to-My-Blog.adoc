Yes, I'm a little late to the party. I've been thinking about starting a personal blog for probably a decade. At first, blogging seemed a bit too trendy for me. I didn't want to contribute more inanity to the already overwhelming amount of chatter being dumped onto the Internet on a daily basis. I wondered if anyone would really care what I had to say or if I would ever have the time to crank out quality blog posts on a regular basis.

I still wonder those things, but I've been feeling more and more as though I have some things I really want to share that can only be disseminated through a blog. I have always been passionate about sharing. The most rewarding part of my job is that I get to share the things I discover with others. At the same time, though, I have been hesitant to self-promote, to push things out on social media. I have  preferred to wait patiently for others to ask about and discover things for themselves. The result has been a lot of potentially useful stuff gathering dust in various physical and mental corners. I hope this blog will be about opening up my virtual garage full of dusty things and offering them for the taking. I hope that they will be useful to someone. 

In October 2014, I was invited to address the South African Operations Research Society at their annual conference. The theme was *Accessible Analytics* and my http://coral.ie.lehigh.edu/~ted/files/talks/AccessibleAnalytics.pdf[talk] discussed the role openness has played in the short history of operations research. I realized this is a topic I am passionate about! The seed was planted for my virtual garage sale.

I began by opening up shop on https://github.com/tkralphs[github] and starting to post little bits and pieces of code I thought others would find useful. I will be writing about some of these here. I discovered https://pages.github.com/[Github pages] and then https://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll], a static generator for blogs that can use https://github.com[Github] as a publishing platform. I played around with it a bit and was hooked. I will write about my experience with https://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] and https://pages.github.com/[Github pages] in a future post.

That's my story. I hope you enjoy my ramblings. I know I will.
