# Ted's Blog 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tkralphs/tkralphs.github.io.svg?branch=jekyll)](https://travis-ci.org/tkralphs/tkralphs.github.io)

This is my personal blog, built on [Travis-CI](travis-ci.org) with 
[jekyll](jekyllrb.com), using 
[Uno-dbyll](http://blog.ankanbiswas.in/uno-dbyll), 
a simple, clean, responsive theme by Ankan Biswas. 

The files associated with the theme were originally obtained under the MIT 
License below. Modifications of the theme were made by Ted Ralphs and the files 
associated with the modified theme are available under the same license.
